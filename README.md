Eureka! is the Inventive Scenario for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay and can serve as an introduction to the game. The scenario was published in 1987 and  was written by Paul Hargraves. It appeared within the pages of White Dwarf 93 and later was reprinted in the Restless Dead campaign where it was accompanied by a page of campaign notes by Carl Sargent that gave advice on how to place it during the Restless Dead campaign or the Enemy Within campaign.

It was later converted to 2nd Edition and made available on the Black Industries site by Andy Law, co-designer of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 4th Edition. I have converted it to 4th Edition unofficially with <strong>amazing</strong> artwork by Alessandro Boer.

This module provides unofficial content to allow GMs to run Eureka! using [Foundry Virtual Tabletop's](https://foundryvtt.com/) [Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay Foundry Core Module](https://www.cubicle7games.com/product-category/foundry/). You'll need a free PDF of Eureka! to run this module successfully, but all maps and actors are supplied in this module.

## Contents
* Actors from the module. 
* Scenes - maps were made by me in Dungeondraft from the original module maps.
* Journals - a smattering of journals are 
* Token files - full tokens for the NPC cast. The unique artwork was all made by Alessandro Boer. 

## Installation 
* Add via Foundry VTT Module Setup screen using the Manifest URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CStuartEKerrigan/WFRP-Eureka-4E-FVTT/master/module.json`
* On launching your world and enabling the module the Initializer should pop up to automatically install all scenes, actors and journal entries. 
* You can also optionally import in the sound playlists if you want audio (storm noises, rain, tavern speech).
* The upper level of the Hooded Man and the Ferry are a series of tiles that are hidden from the players. Reveal them when the time comes.
